            <p><strong>MEI-Trumpet</strong> is an educational web application developed to help trumpet players learn proper fingering and sound production techniques. The app provides customizable exercises where users can select their metronome tempo and desired note range to focus on.</p>
        </header>

        <p>Each exercise follows a simple 3-measure pattern: the first measure is a rest, the second plays a reference note, and in the third, the user plays the note. During the exercise, a visual aid displays the correct trumpet fingering, including slide adjustments for the third valve, helping users associate the proper valve combinations with each note.</p>

            <p class="image-caption">Input interface for setting metronome tempo and note range.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Other features include the option to add a chromatic tuner and dynamic markings to the exercises, enhancing the learning experience. Users can optionally register via email to track their progress, with performance data collected to help monitor improvement over time.</p>

        <p>MEI-Trumpet is part of a research project led by Alberto Acquilino at McGill University, in collaboration with the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF). Ongoing studies aim to refine the appâ€™s pedagogical foundations and assess its usability through user feedback. The source code for the app is publicly available <a href="https://github.com/link">here</a>.</p>

        <p>MEI-Trumpet is available as a free beta version for both web and mobile devices, including iOS and Android.</p>
