            <p>The MEI-Trumpet app is aimed to simplify and enhance the learning process of trumpet fingering and basic tone production for amateurs and professionals alike. It provides an interesting exercise for users to better associate the visual representation of a note on the score with its valve position, and the corresponding pitch.</p>

            <h2>Key Features:</h2>
            <ul class="key-features">
                <li><strong>Customizable Exercises:</strong> Specify your metronome tempo, and select your desired note range to generate a tailored 3-measure exercise. The first measure is rest, followed by a reference sound in the second, and your turn to play in the third.</li>
                <li><strong>Reference Sounds:</strong> Immerse yourself in the rich, high-quality sound of a professional trumpet player. This feature is designed to encourage imitation, a powerful learning tool.</li>
                <li><strong>Visual Aids:</strong> An image of a trumpet is displayed during the exercise, showing you exactly which valves need to be pressed for the corresponding tone. This visual representation is crucial for beginners to associate the pitch of a note with its fingering position.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Benefits:</h2>
            <ul class="benefits">
