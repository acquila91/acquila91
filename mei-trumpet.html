            <p><strong>MEI-Trumpet</strong> is an educational web application designed to facilitate the learning of proper trumpet fingering and sound production techniques. The app offers customizable exercises based on the user's level, allowing them to select the metronome tempo and the desired note range. A 3-measure score is generated in a loop, where the first measure is a rest, the second measure plays the reference note, and the third measure is for the user to play the note.</p>
