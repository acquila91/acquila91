            <p><strong>MEI-Trumpet</strong> is an educational web application developed to help music students learn proper fingering and sound production techniques on trumpet.</p>

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <p>The app provides customizable exercises where users can specify the metronome value and the desired note range:</p>

            <div class="input-image">
                <img src="images/input.jpg" alt="Input Parameters for Tempo and Note Range" class="input-screenshot">
            </div>

            <p>Each exercise is structured in three steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The first measure is a rest, allowing the user to prepare.</li>
                <li>The second measure plays a reference note, offering an example to imitate.</li>
                <li>The third measure is for the user to play the note.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>On the top of the screen, an image showing the correct trumpet fingering, including adjustments for the third valve slide, is displayed. This helps students easily associate the note shown on the musical staff with its pitch and the appropriate valve combination.</p>

            <div class="app-screenshots">
                <img src="images/screenshot.png" alt="App Screenshot 1" class="app-screenshot">
            </div>

            <p>Other features include the option to add a chromatic tuner and dynamic markings (ùÜè, ùÜê, ùÜë), enhancing the learning experience. Users can optionally register via email to track their progress, with performance data collected to help monitor improvement over time.</p>
