            <p><strong>MEI-Trumpet</strong> is an educational web application designed to facilitate the learning of trumpet fingering and sound production techniques. It allows users to customize exercises based on their level, selecting the metronome tempo and note range to focus on.</p>
        </header>

        <p>A 3-measure score is generated in a loop: the first measure is a rest, the second measure provides a reference note, and in the third measure, the user plays the note. The interface includes a visual aid showing the correct valve combinations and any necessary slide adjustments for the third valve, helping users master proper fingering techniques.</p>

            <p class="image-caption">Select metronome tempo and note range through the interface.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Additional features include an optional chromatic tuner and dynamic indicators, which can be added to the exercises for more personalized practice. Users can register via email to enable progress tracking, with performance data collected to monitor improvement over time.</p>

        <p>The development of MEI-Trumpet is part of an ongoing research project led by Alberto Acquilino at McGill University, in collaboration with the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF). This research explores the app's pedagogical foundations and evaluates its usability and social validity with trumpet students and teachers. You can access the source code <a href="https://github.com/link">here</a>.</p>

        <p>MEI-Trumpet is available for free as a beta version, both as a web app and a mobile app on iOS and Android devices.</p>
