            <h2>Features</h2>
            <p>The app provides customizable exercises where users can specify the metronome value and the desired note range:</p>

            <div class="input-image">
                <img src="images/input.jpg" alt="Input Parameters for Tempo and Note Range" class="input-screenshot">
                <p class="image-caption">Input interface for setting metronome tempo and note range.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Each exercise is structured in a clear 3-step pattern: the first measure is a rest, allowing the user to prepare; the second measure plays a reference note, offering an example to imitate; and the third measure is for the user to play the note. Throughout the exercise, a visual aid is displayed showing the correct trumpet fingering, including adjustments for the third valve slide. This ensures users can easily associate each pitch with the appropriate valve combination.</p>

            <p>Other features include the option to add a chromatic tuner and dynamic markings to the exercises, enhancing the learning experience. Users can optionally register via email to track their progress, with performance data collected to help monitor improvement over time.</p>
