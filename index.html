        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a PhD candidate in Educational Technologies at the <a href="https://www.music.mcgill.ca/caml/doku.php" target="_blank">Computational Acoustic Modeling Laboratory</a> 
            of McGill University, supervised by <a href="https://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/" target="_blank">Gary Scavone</a>. 
            My research area focuses on the intersection of music pedagogy and technology with the aim to democratize high-quality education while promoting healthy learning.
            My research interests include the applications of AI, mathematical models and cognitive science to develop low-cost interactive tools for wind 
            and bowed string instruments.</p>
        <p>My doctoral research is kindly funded by the <a href="https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/en/" target="_blank">Fonds de Recherche du Qu√©bec</a>, 
            and I am a <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/gps/funding/opportunities/students/tomlinson" target="_blank">Tomlinson scholar</a>.</p>
